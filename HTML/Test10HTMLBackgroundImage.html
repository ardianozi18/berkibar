<br>it has almost all-white plumage with a black mask and a red bill. The sexes have similar plumage
<br>Adults have red tail streamers that are about twice their body length,
<br>which gives rise to its common name. Nesting takes place in loose colonies on oceanic islands<br>

<br>being incubated by both sexes for about six weeks.<br>
