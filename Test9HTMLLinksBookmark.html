<h1>JAVA</h1>

<br><br>

<h2>Name</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ꦗꦮ; Sundanese: ᮏᮝ) is an island of the Greater Sunda Islands chain,
    bordered by the Indian Ocean on the south and the Java Sea on the north.
    It is administered by Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>With a population of over 141 million (Java only)
    or 145 million (including the inhabitants of its surrounding islands),
    Java has 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the world's most populous island.[1] 
    The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on its northwestern coast.
    Much of Indonesian history took place on Java</p>

<h3 id="C3">Chapter 3</h3>
<p>It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, 
    and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. 
    Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s</p>

<h3 id="C4">Chapter 4</h3>
<p>Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. 
    Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: 
    Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p>Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions from geologic subduction between Sunda Plate and 
    Australian Plate, Java is the 13th largest island in the world 
    and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass at about 138,800 square kilometres (53,600 sq mi).</p>


    <br><br><br>
<h2>Geographically</h2>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p>A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east–west spine along the island. 
    Three main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese, 
    where Javanese is the most spoken; 
    it is the native language of about 60 million Javanese people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p>Furthermore, most residents are bilingual, speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) 
    as their first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, 
    Java's population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p>Java is divided into four administrative provinces, 
    West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.</p>

<h2>Historically</h2>
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p>The origins of the name "Java" are not clear. One possibility is that the island was named after the 
    jáwa-wut plant, which was said to be common in the island during the time, and that prior to 
    Indianization the island had different names.[2] 
    There are other possible sources: the word jaú and its variations mean "beyond" or "distant".[</p>

<h3 id="C10">Chapter 10</h3>
<p>And, in Sanskrit yava means barley, a plant for which the island was famous.[3] 
    "Yavadvipa" is mentioned in India's earliest epic, the Ramayana. Sugriva, 
    the chief of Rama's army dispatched his men to Yavadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p>It was hence referred to in India by the Sanskrit name "yāvaka dvīpa" (dvīpa = island).
     Java is mentioned in the ancient Tamil text Manimekalai by Chithalai Chathanar 
    which states that Java had a kingdom with a capital called Nagapuram.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p>Another source states that the word "Java" is derived from a Proto-Austronesian root word, 
    Iawa meaning "home".[8] The great island of Iabadiu or Jabadiu was mentioned in Ptolemy's 
    Geographia composed around 150 CE in the Roman Empire. Iabadiu is said to mean "barley island", 
    to be rich in gold, and have a silver town called Argyra at the west end. 
    The name indicates Java,[9] and seems to be derived from the Sanskrit name Java-dvipa (Yavadvipa).</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p>The annual news of Songshu and Liangshu referred to Java as She-po (5th century CE),
     He-ling (640–818), then called it She-po again until the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), 
     where they began mentioning Zhao-Wa.[10] According to Ma Huan's book (the Yingya Shenlan),
     the Chinese called Java Chao-Wa, and the island was called She-pó (She-bó) in the past.[11]</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p>When John of Marignolli returned from China to Avignon, 
    he stayed at the Kingdom of Saba for a few months, 
    which he said had many elephants and was led by a queen; 
    Saba may be his interpretation of She-bó.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p>Java lies between Sumatra to the west and Bali to the east. 
    Borneo lies to the north and Christmas Island is to the south. 
    It is the world's 13th largest island. Java is surrounded by the Java Sea to the north, 
    Sunda Strait to the west, 
    the Indian Ocean to the south and Bali Strait and Madura Strait in the east.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p>Java is almost entirely of volcanic origin; 
    it contains thirty-eight mountains forming an east–west spine that have at one time or another been 
    active volcanoes. The highest volcano in Java is Mount Semeru, 3,676 metres (12,060 ft). 
    The most active volcano in Java and also in Indonesia is Mount Merapi, 2,930 metres (9,610 ft). 
    In total, Java has more than 150 mountains.</p>

<h3 id="C17">Chapter 17</h3>
<p>Java's mountains and highlands split the interior into a series of relatively isolated regions 
    suitable for wet-rice cultivation; the rice lands of Java are among the richest in the world.[13] 
    Java was the first place where Indonesian coffee was grown, starting in 1699. 
    Today, Coffea arabica is grown on the Ijen Plateau by small-holders and larger plantations.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p>The area of Java is about 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[13] It is about 1,000 km (620 mi) 
    long and up to 210 km (130 mi) wide. The island's longest river is the 600 km long Solo River.[14] 
    The river rises from its source in central Java at the Lawu volcano, then flows north and eastward 
    to its mouth in the Java Sea near the city of Surabaya. 
    Other major rivers are Brantas, Citarum, Cimanuk and Serayu.</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p>The average temperature ranges from 22 °C (72 °F) to 29 °C (84 °F); 
    average humidity is 75%. The northern coastal plains are normally hotter, 
    averaging 34 °C (93 °F) during the day in the dry season. 
    The south coast is generally cooler than the north, and highland areas inland are even cooler.[15] 
    The wet season begins in November and ends in April. 
    During that rain falls mostly in the afternoons and intermittently during other parts of the year. 
    The wettest months are January and February.</p>

<h3 id="C20">Chapter 20</h3>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Java_Topography.png/260px-Java_Topography.png" alt="Java Island" style="float:left;width:452px;height:232px;"> West Java is wetter than East Java and mountainous regions receive much higher rainfall. 
    The Parahyangan highlands of West Java receive over 4,000 millimetres (160 in) annually, 
    while the north coast of East Java receives 900 millimetres (35 in) annually</p>
</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p>The natural environment of Java is tropical rainforest, 
    with ecosystems ranging from coastal mangrove forests on the north coast, 
    rocky coastal cliffs on the southern coast, and low-lying tropical forests to high altitude 
    rainforests on the slopes of mountainous volcanic regions in the interior. 
    The Javan environment and climate gradually alters from west to east; 
    from wet and humid dense rainforest in western parts, to a dry savanna environment in the east, 
    corresponding to the climate and rainfall in these regions.</p>

<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p>Originally Javan wildlife supported a rich biodiversity, 
    where numbers of endemic species of flora and fauna flourished; 
    such as the Javan rhinoceros,[16] Javan banteng, Javan warty pig, (tiger), Javan hawk-eagle, 
    Javan peafowl, Javan silvery gibbon, Javan lutung, Java mouse-deer, Javan rusa, and Javan leopard.</p>

<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p>With over 450 species of birds and 37 endemic species, Java is a birdwatcher's paradise.[17] 
    There are about 130 freshwater fish species in Java.[18] 
    There are also several endemic amphibian species in Java, including 5 species of tree frogs.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p>Java is an my lovely island. Sadly, only a few people who think it should be guarded, from ourself.</p>
